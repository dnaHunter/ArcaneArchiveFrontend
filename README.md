# Arcane Archives

## Overview

My app is an E-book libary website that will store books and display them to be read. A user will be able to pick from a list of books and them select one to read. Only one person can read each book at one time.

## Installation

- Clone both this and the [backend repository](https://github.com/dnaHunter/ArcaneArchive-api) onto your own systems. Follow the read me on the backend for how to run it.

- Run `npm i` to install dependencies and node modules.

- Make sure you have the backend server running.

- Add the url the backend is running on to the .env file.

- Use `npm start` to run the client server.
